## Project Description

For this project we created a website utilizing a variety of cat images, GIFS, and facts to promote stress relief and well-being for the user. Studies have shown viewing online cat media is related to positive emotions!

## Project Process

The page was created using all language elements that we had learned thus far.  We first drew up a simple wireframe model to get an idea of what the website should look like.  We then built the HTML and CSS to view the framework and design of the website.  Next, we used JavaScript, Web-API, and Server-Side API to let the user navigate through a variety of cat images, GIFs, and facts where they can ultimately save them for a later date.

## Project Outcome

A responsive and dynamic website to help users interact with images, GIFs, and facts about cats to add a sense of well-being to their stressful everyday lives.  When the user clicks on the image tab on the left panel, six randomized images of cats will be generated on the right panel.  Alternatively, the same thing will happen when the user clicks on the GIF or Facts tab as well.  Finally the user has an option to save their favorite images or GIFs for later use.
